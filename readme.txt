This is a experimental addon based on the hello world popup tutorial for Kodi.
It synchronizes two or more kodi devices playing (hopefully the same - not checked) video to roughly (usually only 1 or 2 frames diff) the same position.
One device serves as the master, while all the others connect as slaves (they adjust to the master's time).

Hint: audio might not be in full sync (as mentioned earlier: sync diffs approx. 2 frames).

The actual purpose: Playing the same video in sync e.g. on two tablets e.g. in a car, having just one audio on - the other is on mute.
But the kids can enjoy the same movie on two screens!
